Percona PAM Authentication Plugin for MySQL
-------------------------------------------

(C) 2011 Percona Inc.

This is a Authentication plugin written for the MySQL 5.5 Authentication plugin
API enabling MySQL to perform authentication using PAM. Examples could include
authenticating MySQL users using system accounts or two-factor authentication
systems.

Compiling
---------

You will need both the PAM and MySQL headers installed.

The first command (bootstrap) is only needed if building from the source
code as checked out from the source repository, source tarballs don't require
this step.

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install
